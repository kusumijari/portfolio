			<h2>Learnings : </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					It  was a <b>huge infrastructure</b> and system and understanding this system in itself was a challenge, but once I was got a grasp on it, I was able to understand what goes into creating a stable infrastructure this huge.
				</li>

				<li>
					Along with the infrastructure, it had an immense legacy codebase. Being on this project helped me to understand how to wade through this large codebase. I also learnt the importance of <b>well designed code and test driven development</b>, as it is clearly visible in large codebases like these where which require the code to be self - explanatory and easy to navigate.
				</li>

					Half the team was located in a different country in a different time zone. Working on this project helped me to understand how to coordinate and <b>work with the team remotely</b>.
