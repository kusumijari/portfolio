        <h1> Research Findings </h1>
        <p class="center_align"> Sleep Health was something the team had to do understand very well in order to understand the direction the app would guide you in and also to understand what is possible.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Poor sleep health is a huge concern for atleast 45% of Americans.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sleep Apnea affects not only the person with the disease but also their sleeping partner.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sleep Apnea is not tracked well currently as the only way to  do so is through daily surveys.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sleep health is affected not only by duration but also external factors like caffeine intake, exercise, smoking, food intake and screen exposure.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          Keeping the above research in mind, the first design iteration tried to incorporate the following concepts:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Interactive survey to track information for sleep apnea.
            </li>
            <li>
              A guide to help create a healthy routine controlling exercise, caffeine intake, smoking, food intake, and screen exposure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating games to measure daytime sleepiness.
            </li>
          </ul>
