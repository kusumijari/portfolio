				<p>
					After working on the project, I did a redesign of the dashboard, applying the feedback from the users and knowledge of the domain.

					What did I change?
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Data driving tile size as opposed to tile size driving data.
					</li>
					<li>
						Removal of data that was not being utilised.
					</li>
					<li>
						Adding more information in the home page through interactions.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>My Learnings :</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					This project allowed us to be in close contact with the users, as they were all employees of the company itself. This resulted in receiving <b>continual feedback</b> from the users allowing us to modify the product as we went along and really driving us to make user centric decisions.
				</li>

				<li>
					I got chances to shadow the Experience Designer on the team and understand the <b>design process</b>. I also shadowed <b>user interviews</b> which gave me a chance to see how the user directly interacts with the product for their use cases and participated in <b>design sprints</b>.
				</li>

				<li>
					Understanding operational factors like <b>revenue, gross margins, utilisation etc </b> and how they factor into business decisions.
				</li>

				<li>
					The team adapted the <b>Kanban Process</b> after which we were able to visibly see the increased rate in delivery of features.
				</li>

				<li>
					The infrastructure went through a <b>migration to Amazon Web Services(AWS)</b> which gave me the opportunity to help set up the systems from scratch in a new environment.
				</li>

				<li>
					Building a <b>Continuous Integration</b> environment and <b>Continuous Deployment</b> pipelines from scratch using GO.
				</li>

				<li>
					Clojure (Functional Programming)
				</li>

				<li>
					Angular JS
				</li>

				<li>
					D3
				</li>

				<li>
					ClojureScript
				</li>
			</ul>
