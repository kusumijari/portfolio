							ASU’s Supply Chain Professor created these inital paper prototypes of the games through which
							<ul>
								<li> His idea and concepts of the game were communicated to the designers </li>
								<li> The paper prototypes were used for initial user testing qualitiative factors like - </li>
								<ul>
									<li> How much instructions/information to give beforehand
	 								<li> Which situations/rewards make sense and how much the users care about them </li>
								</ul>
							</ul>

							Examples of other useful Insights - <br>
							<i> “So if I mess this up, patients are goint to die? That doesn’t seem real” <br>
									“Usually wouldn’t I be able to order even if another order is on the way?” <br>

								Keeping in mind the feedback from the testing of the paper prototypes, digital versions of those games were added.
								The game has it’s own storyline and characters to keep the user’s engaged.
								The design team ideates on multiple ideas, building on top of eachother until there is one or two versions that are tested on by users.

								The mockups were tested mostly by students including Ghanian students which was the location for the first Beta test. User testing sessions were conducted with the goal of each session decided beforehand. Some of the things
								we were able to figure out throught these sessions were:
								<ul>
									<li> Ensuring the language of the instructions were simple
										and correctly understood</li>
  								<li> Ensuring that level difficulty is set correctly  </li>
  								<li> Fun factor of the game - making note of boring aspects of the game </li>
  								<li>  Meausuring how much the players learnt from the game</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								Feedback  from these sessions is  recorded and grouped into actionable items if a pattern is found
