			<h2>Problem:</h2>
			<p>As part of our UI/UX consulting class, we were given a tool - <b>TIMU, one comprehensive and integrated project management tool</b>. It was built to make <b>collaboration</b> within office and educational spaces easier, <b>without the need to link to various third party tools</b>. While this product had identified a valid market, there were issues with the execution of the product. The product was difficult to navigate, the intended actions were difficult to find and the overall <b>user experience of the product was frustrating</b>. The task given to us was to find one pain point and fix that in the first iteration. </p>

			<h2>User Interviews</h2>
			<p>Interviews were conducted with about 5 people to understand the followning things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What is the first thing you look at when you start your work day?</li>
				<li>How do you go about your regular work day?</li>
				<li>How often do you think you do the following tasks - Check your email, try to contact someone, check story board?</li>
				<li>What is the most common purpose of attempting the above listed tasks</li>
				<li>What tools are you currently using to help you accomplish your daily tasks?</li>
			</ul>

			<p>After the interview, there was an exploratory <b>Usability Test</b> done. From this a <a class="hyperlink" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzwUnP6ndNtAMTJ4Q0kzMzZXX1k/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Heurisitc Evaluation </a> was prepared.</p>

			<p>From the answers to the above questions, I was able to create the following personas:</p>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
			<p>The major competitors for this kind of tool were <b>Asana</b> and <b>Basecamp</b>.</p>
			<p>Some other tools that are used to accomplish the seperate tasks are Slack, Google Drive, Outlook, GMail, Skype, Jira and many others.</p>
			<p>Although Timu provided similar or better services in terms of features, what it lacked was just <b>simplicity of use</b>.</p>
			<p>What would also give TIMU an upper hand would be to provide project <b>reporting tools</b> using the available data.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Information Architecture</h2>
			<div class="center_align">
				<img class="information_architecture shadow" src="../Images/Timu/Information architecture.jpeg">
			</div>
			<p>Since the system is so complex, understanding the information architecture was essential to figuring out navigation.</p>		
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Iteration One:</h2>
			<p> In the first iteration, the navigation and menu of the product was refined by - 
				<ul>
					<li>Extracting the most commonly used menu items and displaying just those items.</li>
					<li>Removing the two layered vertical menu, as it was confusing the users and not behaving as they expected.</li>
					<li>Having a global horizontal menu for easy access.</li>
					<li>Having a horizontal menu when needed, within the context of the chosen primary menu item.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Initial sketches</h2>
			<p>A number of hand sketces were done to try out multiple layouts, and see which one was the simplest and made the most efficient use of space.</p>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Mockups</h2>
			<p>Using the sketches as a base, and after testing them out, the following mockups were created and were tested through InVision's User Testing feature.</p>
