			<h2>Problem :</h2>
			<p>As part of our UI/UX consulting class, we were given a tool - TIMU, which was built to make <b>collaboration</b> within office and educational spaces easier, <b>without the need to link to various third party tools</b>. While this product had identified a valid market, there were issues with the execution of the product. The product was difficult to navigate, the intended actions were difficult to find and the overall <b>user experience of the product was frustrating</b>. The task given to us was to find one pain point and fix that in the first iteration. </p>
